 Basic Calculator Project

This project is a simple web-based calculator created to brush up on my web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a hands-on opportunity to reinforce foundational concepts while building a functional application.

 Features:

- User-Friendly Interface: The calculator boasts a clean and intuitive layout, making it easy for users to navigate and perform calculations.
- Responsive Design: CSS ensures the calculator adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- Real-Time Calculation: Users receive instant feedback as they input numbers and operations, enhancing the overall user experience.

Technologies Used:

- HTML: Structured the interface, including buttons and display areas.
- CSS: Styled the calculator for a modern, polished look.
- JavaScript: Implemented core functionality, enabling arithmetic operations and user interactions.

This basic calculator not only showcases my ability to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also serves as a stepping stone for further exploration into more complex web development projects.
